/// A raw iterator over a contiguous buffer of elements.

/// `BlitzIterator` provides sequential access to elements stored in unmanaged memory,
/// such as in a `BlitzArray`. It avoids any overhead from ARC or standard collection
/// boxing, and assumes the buffer remains valid for the duration of iteration.
///
/// - Warning: This iterator does **not** retain ownership of the underlying buffer.
///            It is the callerâ€™s responsibility to ensure the memory is valid
///            for the entire iteration lifecycle.
///
/// Used internally by views like `BlitzView`, or can be used directly for
/// low-level traversal of raw arrays.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - Element: The element type being iterated over.
