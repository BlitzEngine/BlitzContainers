# 🚀 BlitzContainers

BlitzContainers is a modern, high-performance collection of data structures built for Swift developers who care about speed, control, and no-nonsense tooling. It’s everything you wish the standard library containers were — and nothing you don’t.

## ⚡️ Why Blitz?
Swift’s built-in containers are fine — until they aren't.

They're designed for convenience, not performance. Safe, general-purpose, and eager to handle every edge case… which makes them bloated, unpredictable, and slower than necessary.

BlitzContainers does the opposite:
- 🔥 Performance-first: Predictable, cache-friendly layouts with minimal overhead.
- 🧠 Smarter defaults: No unnecessary allocations, no hidden copies, no surprises.
- 🛠️ Built for tooling: Ideal for runtime-heavy apps, games, and dev tools.
- 🧱 Modular: Use only what you need — each container is cleanly separated and zero-cost when unused.

## 🧰 What’s Inside?
A growing set of fast, low-level containers:

- BlitzArray: A resizable array that gives you full control over memory.

More to come...

All written with modern Swift features — just without the cost of abstraction.

## 🧪 When to Use Blitz
- You’re building tools, games, or anything where performance genuinely matters.
- You want consistent behaviour, predictable memory access, and minimal overhead.
- You're tired of containers doing too much — and still not doing what you want.

## 🛑 When Not to Use Blitz
- You're hacking together a quick prototype — Swift’s standard containers are totally fine.
- You want safety over control (Blitz leans low-level by design).

## 🤝 Contribute
Spotted a bottleneck in Swift's data structures? Need a container that doesn’t exist yet? Let's build it.

## 🧭 Philosophy
No magic. No overhead. Just fast, predictable containers — the way they should be.
